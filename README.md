### Bitonic Mergesort
```
This file shows code on how to create a Bitonic
Merge sort. This can serve as a guide for people 
wanting to know how to code a bitonic mergesort
in c++.

This Bitonic Mergesort sorts a sequence of numbers 
in parallel. Thus using less memory than a 
traditional mergesort algorithm.
```
### Binary Splay Tree
```
This program combines a binary search tree with 
splaying. Where the latest element is rotated to 
the root. 
#### This program makes use of the following rotation patterns
* zig
* zig-zig
* zig-zag 
```
